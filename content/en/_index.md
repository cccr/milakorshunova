Hi, I’m Mila Korshunova, a screenwriter from Doylestown, Pennsylvania.

A few years ago, I decided to fulfill my long-held dream of becoming a screenwriter.

Since then, I have been actively working on studying the craft and honing my skills.

I’ve already completed one realized short film to my credit.

Currently, I’m working on a new project as a script doctor and also submitting finished scripts to international competitions and film studios.
