Hi, I’m Mila Korshunova, a screenwriter developing image-driven scripts with a strong sense of atmosphere and subtext.

My work includes two short films and two music videos created in collaboration, as well as a recent stop-motion short directed from my own script. Alongside my own projects, I work as a script doctor and develop original screenplays for international markets.
