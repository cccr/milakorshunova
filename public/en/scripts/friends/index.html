A SHAKING MAN - DAY\n\nA SHAKING MAN in earbuds walking around the apartment, holding and petting a CHIHUAHUA.\n\n\nINT. A TALL MAN\u0027S HOUSE - DAY\n\nA TALL MAN is trying outfits on his GREYHOUND.\n\n\nEXT. VILLAGE STREET - DAY\n\nCLAUDIA is hanging up posters on the village walls and bulletin boards. We see the text on a poster: “Dogwalker in your neighborhood, \u002b13475989434, Claudia”.\n\n\nINT.CLAUDIA’S HOUSE - DAY\n\nClaudia is sitting near the dining table with BORIS.\n\nCLAUDIA\nHow I wish we had a dog!\n\n\nBORIS\nWe already discussed it a thousand times, you know my major objection.\n\n\nCLAUDIA\nYep, I remember, you have an allergy to dog’s hair.\n(sighs)\nI\u0027m just thinking out loud.\n\n\nBORIS\nWell, if it makes you feel better, there\u0027s something else..\n\n\nBoris is pointing at the window. It is raining outside the window, and a maple tree is leaning down from the wind.\n\nWe see TWO PEOPLE walking towards each other in raincoats, each with a dog on a leash.\n\nBORIS\nSee?! You have to go outside in any weather! And what about the vacation time? The dog hotels are so expensive!\n\n\nCLAUDIA\nWell, we don’t travel much..\n\n\nBORIS\nWe are moving a lot! Especially lately.\n\n\nClaudia sighs and looks down at her hands and knees under the table. There’re several posters, and Claudia is fiddling with the edge of the paper.\n\n\nINT.CLAUDIA’S HOUSE - NIGHT\n\nIt’s dark and we barely can see the outlines of objects. Claudia is lying on her bed, and her face is lit up with her smartphone. On the phone’s screen we see the text of a message: “ Hi, can you pick up my dog at 7am tomorrow?” Claudia is texting the answer: “Sure, please, tell me your address”. Boris is turning over from side to side.\n\nBORIS\n(grumbles)\nWhy don’t you sleep, hun?\n\n\nClaudia is hiding the phone under the blanket.\n\n\nEXT. VILLAGE STREET - DAY\n\nClaudia is standing at the front door of a house and rings the doorbell. The Tall Man opens the door and looks at Claudia with a straight face. The Greyhound appears at the threshold, and looks at Claudia cautiously, then quickly escapes to the back of the house.\n\n\n\nCLAUDIA\nHello!\n\n\nThe Tall Man is turning his head and looking back in the house. \n\nTHE TALL MAN\n(shouting at the dog)\nI told you, don\u0027t be so shy!\n\n\nThe Tall Man is turning his head back and staring incredulously at Claudia with his brow furrowing.\n\nTHE TALL MAN\nWait a minute. Are you going to walk with him without a car?\n\n\nCLAUDIA\n(confused)\nBut.. there wasn’t anything about the car on your list!\n\n\nTHE TALL MAN\n(angrily to Claudia)\nHow will you get to the park?\n\n\nCLAUDIA\nWell, it’s not so far, you know, just a five minute walk.\n\n\nTHE TALL MAN\nIt’s a Greyhound, not a bus!\n\n\nThe Tall Man is rolling his eyes and slamming the door in Claudia’s face. Claudia is standing confused near the door.\n\n\nEXT. STREET - DAY\n\nA door is opening, and we see a WOMAN on the threshold. Claudia is smiling at the Woman. The Woman hands Claudia A CAT with the harness.\n\nCLAUDIA\n(puzzled)\nBut..it’s a cat!?\n\n\nWOMAN\nSo what?! If you’re a cat you don’t need to be walked? I’ve never heard such nonsense.\n(looking at the cat)\nShe’s strange, Sweetie, right?\n\n\nThe Woman slams the door in Claudia’s face.\n\n\nEXT. STREET - DAY\n\nA door slams in Claudia’s face.\n\n\nEXT. STREET - DAY\n\nMason is standing in a doorway, he has a long gray beard. He’s holding a GRIFFON’s dog, also with a gray beard. Mason is looking down at Claudia.\n\nMASON\nPlease, stay nearby on your walk.\n(pointing at the dog)\nHe doesn’t like to stray far from home.\n\n\nMason is passing a leash to Claudia. The door is closing. Claudia is smiling, she’s getting on one knee, and holding out her palm. The Griffon is sniffing her palm gently. Claudia is petting the Griffon and saying something we can’t hear. Then Claudia is picking up the Griffon, standing up, and turning around from the door, and leading the Griffon down the street.\n\n\nINT. LEONID’S HOUSE - DAY\n\nClaudia holds the Griffon. Mason is sitting in the back of the room and talking on the phone, we can’t hear his words. Mason is glancing at Claudia, then moving the phone from his ear and palming the phone.\n\nMASON\nKatya..\n\n\nCLAUDIA\nClaudia!\n\n\nMASON\nClaudia, please, wash Felix’s paws, I’ll be back in a few minutes.\n\n\nClaudia is walking across the room to the bathroom, looking at the house briefly.\n\nCUT TO\n\n\n\nPOV\n\nClaudia is looking at the room through the narrow gap from the door.\n\nSuddenly Mason is opening the door and staring at the Griffon.\n\nMASON\n(taking the Griffon in his arms)\nWell, Felix looks happy. So, you can come tomorrow morning, and I’ll walk with him after lunch.\n\n\nClaudia is nodding, then looking around the bathroom, and finally wiping her hands on her pants.\n\n\nEXT. STREET - DAY\n\nClaudia is walking with the Griffon by the road. The Shaking Man is going towards Claudia with the Chihuahua on a leash, and with a phone in his other hand. The Shaking Man is staring at his phone, while he passes by Claudia.\n\nClaudia is watching the Shaking Man going. We hear the sound of her ringing phone, and Claudia takes the phone from her pocket. Claudia’s hands start shaking, and the phone is falling on the ground. Claudia is swearing.\n\nCUT TO\n\nLIANE is going towards Claudia with a DOG on a leash.\n\nLIANE\nHi, what a nice dog!\n\n\nCLAUDIA\nWell, thanks! I always wanted to have a dog, but my husband doesn\u0027t want one. So, I’ve started walking other people\u0027s dogs.\n\n\nLIANE\nGood idea!\n(to the dog)\nRich, wait a minute, we’ll go soon.\n(to Claudia)\nBy the way, how long have you been living here? I don\u0027t think I have ever seen you before.\n\n\nCLAUDIA\nOnly for a few months. My husband and I are from the North. We’d lived in New York for five years, but since we can work remotely, we decided to move to a suburb.\n\n\nLIANE\nI used to love New York, but here it\u0027s a quieter and cleaner place.\n\n\nCLAUDIA\n(laughing)\nYes, definitely, and neighbors are more friendly!\n\n\nLIANE\nYou know what, I have an idea: if you like dogs, let’s walk together. My name is Liane, here’s my phone number..\n\n\nClaudia is getting her phone from her pocket, and Liane is still talking, but we can’t hear what she is saying.\n\n\nEXT. STREET - DAY\n\nWe see Mason walking with the Griffon towards Claudia. A CHILD comes close to Mason and tries to pet the Griffon.\n\nMASON\n(Worryingly)\nI’m so sorry, he’s not a very kind friendly dog. You better not bother him.\n\n\nThe Child removes his hand quickly, pouts and resentfully and walks away.\n\n\nEXT. STREET - DAY\n\nClaudia is sitting on a chair near the table. The Griffon lies on the floor and chews a stuffed bear. Claudia takes a piece of dog food from a bag on the table, then comes closer to the Griffon, and gives him a piece of dog food. The Griffon lets Claudia take the stuffed bear from his mouth and takes a piece of food from Claudia’s hand.\n\n\nCLAUDIA\n(petting the Griffon)\nGood boy!\n(sighs)\nIt’s time for you\nto go home, sweetie.\n\n\nClaudia stands up, puts on a coat, takes the Griffon, and goes to the door.\n\n\nINT. CLAUDIA’S HOME - DAY\n\nBoris is sitting on a chair near the table. Claudia is coming from the back to Boris, trying to give a hug. Boris stops Claudia’s hand.\n\nBORIS\nStill busy, sorry.\n\n\nClaudia takes her hand off Boris and shrugs.\n\nCLAUDIA\nBoris, don’t be boring!\n\n\nClaudia turns around and steps away from Boris.\n\nBORIS\nHey, I’m working for us!\n(Sneezing)\nDid you bring a dog into the house today?\n\n\nClaudia stops and looks at Boris, then looks at the floor.\n\nCLAUDIA\n(guilty)\nJust for a moment.\n\n\nBoris is looking at Claudia with a tortured look.\n\nBORIS\nI understand, dear! I’ll\nfinish this project in a\nfew days, and then we can\nspend more time together,\nI promise!\n\n\nClaudia nods, then turns and leaves the room.\n\n\nCUT TO\n\nClaudia is standing in the kitchen near the countertop. On the counter are two bowls with soup. Claudia is turning and goes to the stairs. Then stops, turns her head up and looks at the 2nd floor.\n\nCLAUDIA\nDear, the food is ready,\nlet’s eat!\n\n\nClaudia is coming back to the countertop, carrying the soup bowls with two spoons. She goes to the dinner table. Claudia puts the bowls on the table and sits. Boris is going from the 2nd floor to the middle of the stairs. The phone in Boris’s pocket starts to ring. Boris sighs loudly and has a little guilty look on Claudia.\n\nBORIS\nSo sorry, it’s a project manager. Today is the last day, I have to answer. Don’t wait for me, I’ll eat later.\n\n\nBoris wears his headphones and picks up the phone. Claudia glares at Boris, then takes the spoon and starts to mix her soup with it.\n\nEXT. A STREET NEAR CLAUDIA’S HOME - DAY\n\n\nTITLES: IN A FEW DAYS\n\nA DETECTIVE (45) knocks at the door of Claudia’s house. Nobody opens the door. The Detective observes the areas surrounding the house. We see Liane walking with the Dog on the street. The Detective is waving at Liane and getting closer to her.\n\nTHE DETECTIVE\nDo you know how long ago the people who rented this house moved out?\n\n\nLIANE\n(surprised)\nThat’s strange, I’ve seen Claudia recently. She didn’t tell me, they were going to move. Very nice young woman, I should say. So, what’s the matter?\n\n\nThe Detective takes a photo from his pocket and shows it to Liane.\n\nTHE DETECTIVE\nDo you know this woman?\n\n\nLIANE\n(looking at the picture)\nYes, but what’s going on?\n\n\nLiane looks at the Detective with a question on her face. We see Leonid running from afar.\n\nMASON\nMy dog was stolen!\n\n\n\nINT. BORIS’S CAR - DAY\n\nBoris and Claudia are sitting in the car. Claudia’s holding the Griffon on her knees. Boris holds the steering wheel in a half-face mask. The allergy relief tablets are near, and Boris is opening all the windows. In the back of the car the dogs and cats are sitting together.\n\nAfter titles\n\n\nEXT. STREET - DAY\n\nThe Detective and Mason are standing face to face.\n\nMASON\n(taking his phone from his coat)\nFelix has a small GPS-tracker on his leash.\nWait a minute.\n\n\nMason and the Detective look closely at the phone’s screen: “Location of Felix is detected”. Mason and the Detective look excited.\n\nINT. BORIS’s CAR - DAY\n\nThe Griffon is sitting on Claudia\u0027s knees and we hear the signal from his leash. Claudia is nervous.\n\nCLAUDIA\nYou said, you had disconnected this thing!\n\n\nBoris stops the car, picks up the laptop from Claudia’s feet, opens the laptop, and pushes the button. The signal goes off.\n\n\n\n\n\nEXT. STREET - DAY\n\nThe Detective and Mason are looking at the phone’s screen and laughing. Then we see on the screen: “Location is not found. Try again”.\n\n\nINT. BORIS’S CAR - DAY\n\nCLAUDIA\n(relaxes)\nWhat will we do now?\n\n\nBORIS\nFind new friends!\n\n\nBoris and Claudia are laughing and the car is going forward.\n\nEND`;
